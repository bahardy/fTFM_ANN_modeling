# fTFM_ANNmodeling
Development of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models to close the subgrid terms in the filtered Two-Fluid Model, namely the filtered drag force and the solid phase subgrid stresses.

The dataset and source codes used to train the models will be made available after the review process
